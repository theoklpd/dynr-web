Theos: This repository contains the sources for building one of 3 ubuntu deb packages 
that together make up the dynamic router lite project (DynrLite-II).

The DynrLite-II project allows placing a so called dynamic router between a lan
that contains workstations and a lan that contains internet gateways. The dynamic 
router has a simple web interface that lets the users on the workstations pick
or switch what gateway they want to use. 

The dynr-web package provides a trivial web interface for the DynrLite-II system..
The web interface is written in Python and uses the Django framework at its its core.

Other components of the DynrLite-II project are dynr-pbrouting (A policy based routing core)
and dynr-dns (A policy based dns forwarding daemon),

All DynrLite-II packages are distributed by the dutch national police agency (KLPD) under
the LGPL open source software licence.
